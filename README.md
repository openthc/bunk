# A Mock Cannabis API Interface

This package provides a mock interface for BioTrack, CCRS, METRC and OpenTHC APIs

This software could be deployed on your test network so you can build to a (mostly) functional interface.


## BioTrack

The sample data in the system was modelled after the data for Hawaii, New Mexico and Washington engines.


## CCRS

The sample data and interface is modelled after the Washington engine.


## METRC

The sample data and interface is modelled after the Alaska, California, Colorado, Oregon and Nevada engines.
